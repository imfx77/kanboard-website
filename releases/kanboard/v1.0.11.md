### Swimlanes

![Swimlanes](https://docs.kanboard.org/images/v1/swimlanes.png)

Boards can be divided into horizontal lanes.
So you can have a better organization of your tasks.

By example, in software development you can separate different releases.
Swimlanes are configurable in project settings.

Read the [documentation about swimlanes](https://docs.kanboard.org/v1/user/swimlanes/) for more details.

### Project managers

A new user role is introduced: **Project manager**.
